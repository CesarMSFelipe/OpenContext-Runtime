# Secure Tracing

## Purpose
Traces are product artifacts. Raw context is disabled by default and sanitized traces persist selected/discarded context metadata and token estimates.

## Current Status
Implemented where linked below; broader enterprise controls remain scaffolded and fail closed by default.

## Related Commands
```bash
opencontext doctor security
opencontext security scan .
opencontext prompt audit .
opencontext release audit --dist dist/
opencontext provider simulate --provider openai --classification confidential
```

## Implemented Code
