# Batch Runs

## Purpose
Batch planning shares repo map and retrieval across related questions while keeping separate outputs.

## Current Status
Implemented as local deterministic scaffolds; provider-specific cache and cost integrations are future adapters outside core.

## Related Commands
```bash
opencontext cache plan --query "review auth"
opencontext cache warm --workflow code-review
opencontext cost report
opencontext workflow dry-run security-audit
```

## Implemented Code
