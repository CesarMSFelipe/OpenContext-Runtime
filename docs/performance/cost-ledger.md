# Cost Ledger

## Purpose
CostLedger tracks input, output, cached input, tool, memory, trace, estimated cost, and latency fields. It is currently local/scaffolded.

## Current Status
Implemented as local deterministic scaffolds; provider-specific cache and cost integrations are future adapters outside core.
