# Offline Precomputation

## Purpose
Offline precomputation plans repo map, symbol index, dependency graph scaffold, token heatmap, security scan, memory summaries, and static prefixes.

## Current Status
Implemented as local deterministic scaffolds; provider-specific cache and cost integrations are future adapters outside core.
